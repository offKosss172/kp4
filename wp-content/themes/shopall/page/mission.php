		<h2>OUR MISSION</h2>

  				<div class="our-mission-section-kosss-missiontext-content-master">
					<h3>OUR PLANET</h3>
					<p>Just like great flowers, our sustainability mission starts with solid foundations.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
				In 2021, we increased the number of electric vehicles delivering our flowers across London, LA, and New York, with the goal of continuing to grow our fleet.
  				<br>
				<br>
				We have closely monitored last year’s carbon footprint, and have offset <br>
				it by <b>100% in 2022,</b> with an aim of reducing it at source by <b>200%</b> <br>
				over the next 3 years.
  				<br>
				<br>
				And it is not just what happens once our flowers have left the building that matters. At our London HQ, we work with a waste management partner, collaborating to convert waste into energy through composting, meaning that nothing from our warehouse site is sent to landfill.
				</p>

					<h3>OUR FLOWERS</h3>
					<p>Only the most extraordinary flowers; not only in their quality and beauty, but in their credentials.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
				Our <b> cut-to-order</b> model is paramount to this, meaning that <b>every stem is selected for purpose,</b> with the aim of sparking joy in a home around the globe, and never ending up in landfill.
  				<br><br>
				We work to <b>a seasonal calendar</b>with suppliers that respect our need for this, allowing our customers to experience month on-month floral evolution as nature intended.

		<h2>OUR PACKAGING</h2>
		<p>Since 2019, our cardboard and paper packaging has been <b>100% recyclable, sourced from certified FSC providers.</b> All components of our non-gifting bouquets are fully compostable; from our flower food sachets, to water pads, tape, and string. When it comes to developments in this area, we know that there is always more to be done, so our ever-evolving strategy starts with looking to reduce delivery box size to help combat cardboard waste. </p>

				<h2>OUR PEOPLE</h2>
				<p>From the start of our flowers’ journey, to wherever they end up; every person matters. We already source from local suppliers where we can, with the hope of growing the number of smaller flower farms we work with by 20% this year.
				<br>
				We are a female-founded and led brand, with CEO Whitney Bromberg Hawkings at our helm. Our internal workforce is currently made up of over 85% female staff, with a focus on diversity and representation across the business as a priority.</p>
