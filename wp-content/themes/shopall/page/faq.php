FLOWER INFORMATION</i><br>
<b>Where do your flowers come from?</b><br>

<b>I have some feedback on my flowers</b><br>

We really value customer feedback be that the "good" or the "not so good." If you do need to get in touch with our Customer Service team, we will be on hand to help answer your query.<br>


<b>How can I make the most out of my flowers?</b><br>

To keep your flowers as fresh as possible, we recommend trimming the stems at a 45° angle on receiving them and changing the water every few days. Your flowers will also benefit from the use of flower food. It’s important to keep them away from direct sunlight and heat and instead place them in a cool environment. Most flowers will perform best if kept in temperatures between 10 and 15°c.<br>
