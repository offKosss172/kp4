		<h4><b>FLOWER SUBSCRIPTION</b></h4>
		<p><b>How does a flower subscription work?</b></p>
		<p>Choose from our range of flower subscriptions. Simply select the type of subscription you want and choose your duration for 3, 6, or 12 months of flowers. Opt for weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly flower deliveries, and pick your first delivery date. We promise to only ever send you flower stems at their very best, every month of the year.</p>
  		<p><b>How often will I recieve my flowers?</b></p>
		<p>Once you have chosen your start date you'll recieve your flowers weekly, bi-weekly or monthly depending on the subscription plan you have chosen. Complimentary delivery is included on all subscriptions.</p>
		<p><b>What flowers will I receive with my subscription?</b></p>
		<p>Your subscription will include signature FLOWERBX flowers. These will include customer favourite single stem bouquets such as roses, tulips, peonies, hydrangeas, and more - dependant on seasonality. </p>
		<p><b>Do the flowers come with a vase?</b></p>
		<p>Your flowers come with a vase as part of your subscription. A vase will be delivered alongside your first order and will be suited to a variety of stems throughout the season so you can enjoy it all year round.</p>
		<p><b>What do I receive in my subscription?</b></p>
		<p>With your subscription, you will receive seasonal fresh flowers, every time. Each subscription delivery will come with curated care tips and a sachet of FLOWERBX Flower Food to keep your stems looking their best. You will also receive a complimentary vase with your first order, plus perks along the way.</p>
		<p><b>Can I change the address or date on my subscription?</b></p>
		<p>If you need to make any changes to your subscription, whether its the date, address or frequency please contact our customer service team who will be happy to help make any changes for you.</p>
		<p><b>Can I buy a flower subscription as a gift for someone else?</b></p>
		<p>Yes! You can buy a subscription for yourself or for someone else. Our Subscription Gift Card allows you to send flowers to a loved one on repeat, with a complimentary vase alongside their first delivery.</p>
