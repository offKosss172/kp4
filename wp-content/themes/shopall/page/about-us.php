	<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
	<div class="section-about-us-kosss-second-foto"></div>
  	<h3>MEET WHITNEY BROMBERG HAWKINGS, FLOWERBX FOUNDER AND CEO</h3>
	<p>Our story started when ex-Senior Vice President of Communications at TOM FORD - now, FLOWERBX founder and CEO - Whitney Bromberg Hawkings, was in search of luxury, single-variety flowers at an accessible price point, but could not find a florist or supplier that made her experience simple, reliable, and premium. And she was not alone, with like-minded flower lovers from London to Los Angeles encountering the same inconvenience. With similar expectations exceeded when shopping for everything from clothes to groceries, Whitney recognised a niche in the market to deliver best-in-show florals to the front doorsteps of customers across the globe. With that, FLOWERBX was born, and our mantra has remained the same ever since.</p>
