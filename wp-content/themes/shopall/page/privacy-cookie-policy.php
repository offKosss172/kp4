		<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
		<p>Welcome to www.flowerbx.com (our "website"). <br>

FLOWERBX is committed to delivering exceptional flowers to you, our customers. We also respect your privacy. This privacy policy sets out how we use and protects any information that you provide us when you use this website, order from us, correspond with us, or otherwise use our services (collectively, our "Services"). It also tells you about your privacy rights and how certain laws may apply to you.<br>

<p><b><u>1. About us </u></b></p>

<p><b><u>2. What personal data do we collect? </u></b></p>
<br>
<p>'Personal data' means any data which can be associated with you as an individual, either directly or indirectly. We collect different information depending on how you use the Services and how you interact with us. <br>

The personal data we may collect includes: <br>

Your identity and contact information, including your name, email address, telephone number and billing and shipping addresses. <br>
Usage data, which includes information about how you use our Services (including your delivery instructions, order/shopping history, search criteria, preferences, website activity, and if you have attended any of our events). <br>
Technical data, such as the device you are using to access our website, your unique device ID, your internet protocol (IP), browser type and version, time zone and location, display settings, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access our website . <br>

These are applied at random and you may be asked to authenticate your purchase by entering a unique one-use passcode, which your card issuer will send to your phone. <br>

We do not collect data about actual or alleged criminal offences.</p>

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.  <br>

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us to analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to our customers' needs.<br>
<br>
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to remember settings so that you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you visit a new page; monitoring which pages you find useful and which you do not; displaying information on a website in a way that matches your interests; and remembering key information such as your postcode so that you do not have to enter it repeatedly.<br>
